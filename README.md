# Dupe Released on July 13

This is the source code of the dupe method publicly available, released on July 13, 2021. It is decompiled for your convenience to view.

The main offending file is called [ActualDupe.cs](Noidea/Core/Components/ActualDupe.cs).

It extends the abstract class [Component.cs](Noidea/Core/Component.cs).

I believe it makes use of a method to log into an account multiple times. The file for this is [here](Noidea/Core/Client.cs).
